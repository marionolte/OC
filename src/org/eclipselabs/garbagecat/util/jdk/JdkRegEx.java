     * padding) so that it will finish just in time before the old generation becomes full.

     * </p>
     * 
     * <ol>
     * <li>The heap is too small.</li>
     * <li>There is a change in application behavior (e.g. a load increase) that causes the young promotion rate to
     * exceed historical data. If this is the case, the concurrent mode failures will happen near the change in
     * behavior, then after a few collections the CMS collector will adjust based on the new promotion rate. Performance
     * will suffer for a short period until the CMS collector recalibrates. Use -XX:CMSInitiatingOccupancyFraction=NN
     * (default 92) to handle changes in application behavior; however, the tradeoff is that there will be more
     * collections.</li>
     * <li>The application has large variances in object allocation rates, causing large variances in young generation
     * promotion rates, leading to the CMS collector not being able to accurately predict the time between collections.
     * Use -XX:CMSIncrementalSafetyFactor=NN (default 10) to start the concurrent collection NN% sooner than the
     * calculated time.</li>
     * <li>There is premature promotion from the young to the old generation, causing the old generation to fill up with
     * short-lived objects. The default value for -XX:MaxTenuringThreshold for the CMS collector is 0, meaning that
     * objects surviving a young collection are immediately promoted to the old generation. Use
     * -XX:MaxTenuringThreshold=32 to allow more time for objects to expire in the young generation.</li>
     * <li>If the old generation has available space, the cause is likely fragmentation. Fragmentation can be avoided by
     * increasing the heap size.</li>
     * <li>The Perm/Metaspace fills up during the CMS cycle. The CMS collector does not collect Perm/Metaspace by
     * default. Add -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled to collect Perm/Metaspace in the CMS concurrent cycle. If the
     * concurrent mode failure is not able to reclaim Perm/Metaspace, also increase the size. For example:
     * -XX:PermSize=256M -XX:MaxPermSize=256M (Perm) or -XX:MetaspaceSize=2G -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=2G (Metaspace).</li>
