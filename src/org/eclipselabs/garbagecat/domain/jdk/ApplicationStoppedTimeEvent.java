/**
 * <p>
 * APPLICATION_STOPPED_TIME
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Logging enabled with the <code>-XX:+PrintGCApplicationStoppedTime</code> JVM option. It shows the time spent in a
 * safepoint, when all threads are stopped and reachable by the JVM. Many JVM operations require that all threads be in
 * a safepoint to execute. The most common is a "stop the world" garbage collection.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This option used to only include garbage collection time, and it used to not be accurate. Therefore it was ignored.
 * However, beginning in JDK7/8, it started included stopped time for the other JVM operations performed at safepoint.
 * Therefore, it is now a required logging option to determine overall throughput and identify throughput and pause
 * issues not related to garbage collection.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Other JVM operations that require a safepoint:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>ThreadDump</li>
 * <li>HeapDumper</li>
 * <li>GetAllStackTrace</li>
 * <li>PrintThreads</li>
 * <li>PrintJNI</li>
 * <li>RevokeBias</li>
 * <li>Deoptimization</li>
 * <li>FindDeadlock</li>
 * <li>EnableBiasLocking</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <h3>Example Logging</h3>
 * 
 * <p>
 * 1) Standard format:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * Total time for which application threads were stopped: 0.0968457 seconds
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <h3>Example Logging</h3>
 * 
 * <p>
 * 1) Prior to JDK8 update 40:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * Total time for which application threads were stopped: 0.0968457 seconds
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * 2) JDK8 update 40 with the time (out of the total stopped time) waiting for the threads to arrive at a safepoint (
 * "Stopping threads took"):
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * 0.147: Total time for which application threads were stopped: 0.0000921 seconds, Stopping threads took: 0.0000190 seconds
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * 3) With negative stopped time. A bug?
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * 51185.692: Total time for which application threads were stopped: -0.0005950 seconds, Stopping threads took: 0.0003310 seconds
 * </pre>
